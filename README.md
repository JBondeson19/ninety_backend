# Ninety 

Ninety is a single page web app designed to motivate creators with writer's block. Get your hands and brain moving with randomly generated writing prompts that you can then share and get feedback on from other users. 

This is the Rails server to support user models and their respective relationships. 

### Technologies

* Ruby 2.6.1 
* Rails 6

### Setup 
1. Check out the repository:
` git clone https://github.com/JBondeson19/ninety_backend`

2. configure the database
`rails db:create`
`rails db:migrate`
3. gem install
